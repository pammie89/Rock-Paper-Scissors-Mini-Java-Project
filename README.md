## Summary


This is a fun Paper, Rock, Scissors game that is played inside your terminal.
The game allows the player to choose between three options: playing against another human, playing against a computer, or exiting the game. In the two-player mode, each player selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the game declares a winner. In the versus computer mode, the player chooses their move, the computer selects a move, and the game declares a winner. The game asks the player if they want to play again after each round.
